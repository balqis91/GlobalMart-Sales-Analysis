# Output 
The data was successfully loaded into the jupyter notebook and the code snippet below was used to view the first rows of the dataset to confirm it has been successfuylly loaded.

To ensure the data was ready for analysis:
- Missing values in relevant columns such as "Postal Code" were replaced with zeros(0) for consistency.

- Non-numeric columns were reviewed for categorical consistency (e.g., Product Category).
After successful cleaning of the dataset, the analysis proceed to the exploratory data analyis(EDA).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
